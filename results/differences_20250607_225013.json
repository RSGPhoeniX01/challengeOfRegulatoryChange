If the investigational product is provided by the sponsor-investigator, then they\nshould provide the necessary information to the investigator site staff. Where\npermitted by regulatory authorities, the current scientific information such as a basic\nproduct information brochure (e.g., summary of product characteristics package\nleaflet, or labelling) may be an appropriate alternative, provided that it includes\ncurrent, comprehensive and detailed information on all aspects of the investigational\nproduct that might be of importance to the investigator. If an authorised medicinal\nproduct is being studied for a new use (i.e., a new indication), an IB specific to that\nnew use should be prepared unless there is a rationale for only one IB. The IB should\nbe reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary in compliance with a sponsor\u2019s\ndocumented procedures. More frequent revision may be appropriate depending on the\nstage of development and the generation of relevant new information. Relevant new\ninformation may be so important that it needs to be communicated to the investigators\nand possibly to the IRBs/IECs and/or regulatory authorities before it is included in a\nrevised IB."

      "original": "INTEGRATED ADDENDUM TO ICH E6(R1): GUIDELINE FOR\nGOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE ICH\nE6(R2)\nINTRODUCTION\nGood Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for\ndesigning, conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the participation of human\nsubjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety and\nwell-being of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin\nin the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible.\nThe objective of this ICH GCP Guideline is to provide a unified standard for the European\nUnion (EU), Japan and the United States to facilitate the mutual acceptance of clinical data\nby the regulatory authorities in these jurisdictions.\nThe guideline was developed with consideration of the current good clinical practices of the\nEuropean Union, Japan, and the United States, as well as those of Australia, Canada, the\nNordic countries and the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThis guideline should be followed when generating clinical trial data that are intended to be\nsubmitted to regulatory authorities.\nThe principles established in this guideline may also be applied to other clinical\ninvestigations that may have an impact on the safety and well-being of human subjects.\nADDENDUM\nSince the development of the ICH GCP Guideline, the scale, complexity, and cost of clinical\ntrials have increased. Evolutions in technology and risk management processes offer new\nopportunities to increase efficiency and focus on relevant activities. When the original ICH\nE6(R1) text was prepared, clinical trials were performed in a largely paper-based process.\nAdvances in use of electronic data recording and reporting facilitate implementation of other\napproaches. For example, centralized monitoring can now offer a greater advantage, to a\nbroader range of trials than is suggested in the original text. Therefore, this guideline has\nbeen amended to encourage implementation of improved and more efficient approaches to\nclinical trial design, conduct, oversight, recording and reporting while continuing to ensure\nhuman subject protection and reliability of trial results. Standards regarding electronic\nrecords and essential documents intended to increase clinical trial quality and efficiency have\nalso been updated.\nThis guideline should be read in conjunction with other ICH guidelines relevant to the\nconduct of clinical trials (e.g., E2A (clinical safety data management), E3 (clinical study\nreporting), E7 (geriatric populations), E8 (general considerations for clinical trials), E9\n(statistical principles), and E11 (pediatric populations)).\nThis ICH GCP Guideline Integrated Addendum provides a unified standard for the European\nUnion, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Switzerland to facilitate the mutual acceptance\nof data from clinical trials by the regulatory authorities in these jurisdictions. In the event of\nany conflict between the E6(R1) text and the E6(R2) addendum text, the E6(R2) addendum\ntext should take priority."

A monitor\u2019s qualifications\nshould be documented.\n(c) Monitors should be thoroughly familiar with the investigational product(s), the\nprotocol, written informed consent form and any other written information to be\nprovided to subjects, the sponsor\u2019s SOPs, GCP, and the applicable regulatory\nrequirement(s).\n5.18.3 Extent and Nature of Monitoring\nThe sponsor should ensure that the trials are adequately monitored. The sponsor should\ndetermine the appropriate extent and nature of monitoring. The determination of the\nextent and nature of monitoring should be based on considerations such as the objective,\npurpose, design, complexity, blinding, size, and endpoints of the trial. In general there is\na need for on-site monitoring, before, during, and after the trial; however in exceptional\ncircumstances the sponsor may determine that central monitoring in conjunction with\nprocedures such as investigators\u2019 training and meetings, and extensive written guidance\ncan assure appropriate conduct of the trial in accordance with GCP. Statistically\ncontrolled sampling may be an acceptable method for selecting the data to be verified.\nADDENDUM\nThe sponsor should develop a systematic, prioritized, risk-based approach to monitoring\nclinical trials. The flexibility in the extent and nature of monitoring described in this\nsection is intended to permit varied approaches that improve the effectiveness and\nefficiency of monitoring. The sponsor may choose on-site monitoring, a combination of\non-site and centralized monitoring, or, where justified, centralized monitoring. The\nsponsor should document the rationale for the chosen monitoring strategy (e.g., in the\nmonitoring plan).\nOn-site monitoring is performed at the sites at which the clinical trial is being conducted.\nCentralized monitoring is a remote evaluation of accumulating data, performed in a\ntimely manner, supported by appropriately qualified and trained persons (e.g., data\nmanagers, biostatisticians)."

Its\npurpose is to provide the investigators and others involved in the trial with the information to\nfacilitate their understanding of the rationale for, and their compliance with, many key features\nof the protocol, such as the dose, dose frequency/interval, methods of administration: and safety\nmonitoring procedures. The IB also provides insight to support the clinical management of the\nstudy subjects during the course of the clinical trial. The information should be presented in a\nconcise, simple, objective, balanced, and non-promotional form that enables a clinician, or\npotential investigator, to understand it and make his/her own unbiased risk-benefit assessment of\nthe appropriateness of the proposed trial. For this reason, a medically qualified person should\ngenerally participate in the editing of an IB, but the contents of the IB should be approved by the\ndisciplines that generated the described data.\nThis guideline delineates the minimum information that should be included in an IB and\nprovides suggestions for its layout. It is expected that the type and extent of information\navailable will vary with the stage of development of the investigational product. If the\ninvestigational product is marketed and its pharmacology is widely understood by medical\npractitioners, an extensive IB may not be necessary. Where permitted by regulatory authorities, a\nbasic product information brochure, package leaflet, or labelling may be an appropriate\nalternative, provided that it includes current, comprehensive, and detailed information on all\naspects of the investigational product that might be of importance to the investigator. If a\nmarketed product is being studied for a new use (i.e., a new indication), an IB specific to that\nnew use should be prepared. The IB should be reviewed at least annually and revised as\nnecessary in compliance with a sponsor's written procedures. More frequent revision may be\nappropriate depending on the stage of development and the generation of relevant new\ninformation. However, in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, relevant new information may\nbe so important that it should be communicated to the investigators, and possibly to the\nInstitutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) and/or regulatory\nauthorities before it is included in a revised IB.\nGenerally, the sponsor is responsible for ensuring that an up-to-date IB is made available to the\ninvestigator(s) and the investigators are responsible for providing the up-to-date IB to the\nresponsible IRBs/IECs. In the case of an investigator sponsored trial, the sponsor-investigator\nshould determine whether a brochure is available from the commercial manufacturer. If the\ninvestigational product is provided by the sponsor-investigator, then he or she should provide the\nnecessary information to the trial personnel. In cases where preparation of a formal IB is\nimpractical, the sponsor-investigator should provide, as a substitute, an expanded background\ninformation section in the trial protocol that contains the minimum current information described\nin this guideline.\n7.2"

Filing essential documents at the investigator/institution and sponsor sites\nin a timely manner can greatly assist in the successful management of a trial by the investigator, sponsor and monitor. These documents are also\nthe ones which are usually audited by the sponsor's independent audit function and inspected by the regulatory authority(ies) as part of the\nprocess to confirm the validity of the trial conduct and the integrity of data collected.\nThe minimum list of essential documents which has been developed follows. The various documents are grouped in three sections according to\nthe stage of the trial during which they will normally be generated: 1) before the clinical phase of the trial commences, 2) during the clinical\nconduct of the trial, and 3) after completion or termination of the trial. A description is given of the purpose of each document, and whether it\nshould be filed in either the investigator/institution or sponsor files, or both. It is acceptable to combine some of the documents, provided the\nindividual elements are readily identifiable.\nTrial master files should be established at the beginning of the trial, both at the investigator/institution\u2019s site and at the sponsor's office. A final\nclose-out of a trial can only be done when the monitor has reviewed both investigator/institution and sponsor files and confirmed that all\nnecessary documents are in the appropriate files.\nAny or all of the documents addressed in this guideline may be subject to, and should be available for, audit by the sponsor\u2019s auditor and\ninspection by the regulatory authority(ies).\nADDENDUM\nThe sponsor and investigator/institution should maintain a record of the location(s) of their respective essential documents including source\ndocuments. The storage system used during the trial and for archiving (irrespective of the type of media used) should provide for document\nidentification, version history, search, and retrieval.\nEssential documents for the trial should be supplemented or may be reduced where justified (in advance of trial initiation) based on the\nimportance and relevance of the specific documents to the trial."
