If the investigational product is provided by the sponsor-investigator, then they\nshould provide the necessary information to the investigator site staff. Where\npermitted by regulatory authorities, the current scientific information such as a basic\nproduct information brochure (e.g., summary of product characteristics package\nleaflet, or labelling) may be an appropriate alternative, provided that it includes\ncurrent, comprehensive and detailed information on all aspects of the investigational\nproduct that might be of importance to the investigator. If an authorised medicinal\nproduct is being studied for a new use (i.e., a new indication), an IB specific to that\nnew use should be prepared unless there is a rationale for only one IB. The IB should\nbe reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary in compliance with a sponsor\u2019s\ndocumented procedures. More frequent revision may be appropriate depending on the\nstage of development and the generation of relevant new information. Relevant new\ninformation may be so important that it needs to be communicated to the investigators\nand possibly to the IRBs/IECs and/or regulatory authorities before it is included in a\nrevised IB.",
